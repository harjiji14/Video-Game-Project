My work is focused only on the implementations in **Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld,h, and StudentWorld.cpp**. Other implementations that provide the background framework of the project is provided by UCLA.
I have removed cpp files that do not interfere with understanding my implementations for the purpose of preseving academic integrity.
Game assets are truncated and displays a sample level. Graphical Representations are not shown to preserve academic integrity & restrict unlicensed redistribution.
